Consider developing a database of new born babies at KMC maternity department with class name as NewBornBaby and attributes:
	

		
babyID : String
		
weight : String
		
dob : Date
		
motherName : String
		
gender: char (F/M)
	
	


Initially create a constructor with above parameters and insert minimum of 5 babies details. Next for the above class let us introduce two more attributes as bcg:date and polio:date which specifies the BCG and polio dates for the baby. Assume that BCG should be given on 45th day and polio in 3rd month after the baby’s birth. 

Your application should take the baby’s ID and mother’s name as input and display the BCG and Polio date for respective baby. (Note: Display when the baby should be vaccinated)
